Put the script you want to use in the same directory as your Minecraft.exe (or alternatively, put
Minecraft.exe in the same directory as the scipt). When you start the script, it attempts to load
the game at the same time. If you do not do this you will get a "Failed attempt to launch program
or document" error.

Script Function:
	Difference between Standard and ESDF Version of Minecraft Remaps:
	- Autowalk sends E instead of W.
	- That's all!

	The following only apply inside the Minecraft window, and assume default Minecraft controls:
	1)Mouse Button 4, Mouse Button 5 and Insert toggle hold-left-click. Handy for breaking
		lots of blocks or mining obsidian.
	2) PgDn key spams right-click very quickly. Excellent for egg spam!
	3) Home toggles autowalking on and off, allowing you to move forward without holding down the
		key. Use with mouse-hold toggle for automated mining action!
	4) LShift toggles crouching upon double-pressing it. Press it again (once) to turn off.
	5) PrintScreen takes a screenshot using Minecraft's built-in tool.
	6) Holding MButton spams left-click. No longer click 64 times when crafting a stack.
	7) Hit Ctrl+H to instantly teleport to your /sethome location. Handy for escaping ambushes.
	8) Hit Ctrl+P to instantly teleport to the spawn point.


Game Compatibility:
	- Minecraft (all versions, as long as Window Title remains "Minecraft".)

Usage:
	Either run the compiled .exe, or download Autohotkey and run the included source .ahk. To exit
	the script, right-click the green H icon in your taskbar and select Exit.

Notes:
	You may experience problems typing while the crouch-toggle or walk-toggle is in effect. To
	regain control, just toggle off that function.
